2013-XX-XX   0.8.2:
-------------------


2013-03-30   0.8.1:
-------------------
  * fix issue #10, i.e. int(bitarray()) segfault
  * added tests for using a bitarray object as an argument to functions
    like int, long (on Python 2), float, list, tuple, dict


2012-04-04   0.8.0:
-------------------
  * add Python 2.4 support
  * add (module level) function bitdiff for calculating the difference
    between two bitarrays


2012-02-15   0.7.0:
-------------------
  * add iterdecode method (C level), which returns an iterator but is
    otherwise like the decode method
  * improve memory efficiency and speed of pickling large bitarray objects


2012-02-06   0.6.0:
-------------------
  * add buffer protocol to bitarray objects (Python 2.7 only)
  * allow slice assignment to 0 or 1, e.g. a[::3] = 0  (in addition to
    booleans)
  * moved implementation of itersearch method to C level (Lluis Pamies)
  * search, itersearch now only except bitarray objects,
    whereas __contains__ excepts either booleans or bitarrays
  * use a priority queue for Huffman tree example (thanks to Ushma Bhatt)
  * improve documentation


2012-02-02   0.5.2:
-------------------
  * fixed MSVC compile error on Python 3 (thanks to Chris Gohlke)
  * add missing start and stop optional parameters to index() method
  * add examples/compress.py


2012-01-31   0.5.1:
-------------------
  * update documentation to use tobytes and frombytes, rather than tostring
    and fromstring (which are now deprecated)
  * simplified how tests are run


2012-01-23   0.5.0:
-------------------
  * added itersearch method
  * added Bloom filter example
  * minor fixes in docstrings, added more tests


2011-12-29   0.4.0:
-------------------
  * porting to Python 3.x (Roland Puntaier)
  * introduced tobytes, frombytes (tostring, fromstring are now deprecated)
  * updated development status
  * added sieve prime number example
  * moved project to github: https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray


2009-04-06   0.3.5:
-------------------
  * fixed reference counts bugs
  * added possibility to slice assign to True or False, e.g. a[::3] = True
    will set every third element to True


2009-01-15   0.3.4:
-------------------
  * Made C code less ambiguous, such that the package compiles on
    Visual Studio, will all tests passing.


2008-12-14   0.3.3:
-------------------
  * Made changes to the C code to allow compilation with more compilers.
    Compiles on Visual Studio, although there are still a few tests failing.


2008-10-19   0.3.2:
-------------------
  * Added sequential search method.
  * The special method __contains__ now also takes advantage of the
    sequential search.


2008-10-12   0.3.1:
-------------------
  * Simplified state information for pickling.  Argument for count is now
    optional, defaults to True.  Fixed typos.


2008-09-30   0.3.0:
-------------------
  * Fixed a severe bug for 64bit machines.  Implemented all methods in C,
    improved tests.
  * Removed deprecated methods from01 and fromlist.


2008-09-23   0.2.5:
-------------------
  * Added section in README about prefix codes.  Implemented _multiply method
    for faster __mul__ and __imul__.  Fixed some typos.


2008-09-22   0.2.4:
-------------------
  * Implemented encode and decode method (in C) for variable-length prefix
    codes.
  * Added more examples, wrote README for the examples.
  * Added more tests, fixed some typos.


2008-09-16   0.2.3:
-------------------
  * Fixed a memory leak, implemented a number of methods in C.
    These include __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, pop, remove,
    insert.  The methods implemented on the Python level is very limit now.
  * Implemented bitwise operations.


2008-09-09   0.2.2:
-------------------
  * Rewrote parts of the README
  * Implemented memory efficient algorithm for the reverse method
  * Fixed typos, added a few tests, more C refactoring.


2008-09-07   0.2.1:
-------------------
  * Improved tests, in particular added checking for memory leaks.
  * Refactored many things on the C level.
  * Implemented a few more methods.


2008-09-02   0.2.0:
-------------------
  * Added bit endianness property to the bitarray object
  * Added the examples to the release package.


2008-08-17   0.1.0:
-------------------
  * First official release; put project to
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray/


May 2008:

Wrote the initial code, and put it on my personal web-site:
